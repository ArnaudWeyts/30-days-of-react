# 30 days of React

This is my code while I'm following along with [https://www.fullstackreact.com/30-days-of-react/](https://www.fullstackreact.com/30-days-of-react/).

Update: I stopped this course at lesson 22-ish. It's good for a free course, but still lacks some optimization or starter files. Some of the code isn't correct, and I just got tired of it. The main problem is that they don't dive deep enough into React & Redux. And just shimmering the surface of those 2 isn't quite what I was looking for. The very start of the course however is a great way to get into basic React.
